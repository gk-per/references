# Chocolate Cupcakes
## Ingredients 
- Nonstick cooking spray or cupcake liners
- 240 grams all-purpose flour
- 85 grams cocoa powder
- 5 grams kosher salt
- 7 grams baking soda
- 7 grams baking powder
- 225 grams unsalted butter, room temperature
- 400 grams granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- 10 grams vanilla extract
- 360 grams sour cream
- 60 grams vegetable oil

## Steps:

1) Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.
2) In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.
3) In a separate large bowl, cream the butter and sugar with an electric hand mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
4) Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat until fully incorporated.
5) Add the vanilla extract, sour cream, and vegetable oil. Stir with a rubber spatula until starting to incorporate, then beat with the hand mixer until fully combined.
6) Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, beating between each addition until just combined.
7) Fill Cupcake Liners: Use a scoop or spoon to fill each cupcake liner about 2/3 full with batter.
8) Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs.
9) Let the cupcakes cool in the muffin tin for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
