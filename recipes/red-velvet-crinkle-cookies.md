# Red Velvet Crinkle Cookies Recipe
## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients:
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup powdered sugar (for rolling)
### Wet Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon white vinegar (to enhance red color and tenderness)
- 1-2 tablespoons red food coloring (optional, adjust for desired color)

## Steps
1) Preheat and Prep: Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
2) Dry Ingredients: Sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3) Cream Butter and Sugar: Beat the butter and granulated sugar until creamy.
4) Add Eggs and Flavorings: Mix in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla, vinegar, and food coloring.
5) Combine: Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet, until a dough forms.
6) Chill: Cover the dough and chill for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
7) Shape and Sugar Coat: Once chilled, scoop the dough into balls, roll them in powdered sugar, and place them on the baking sheets.
8) Bake: Bake for 10-12 minutes, just until they rise and form cracks.
9) Cool: Let them cool on the sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack.
