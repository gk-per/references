# RK4 with Haskell and Elixir

## Purpose: 
The idea is to show application of solving some ordinary differential equations with the RK4 algorithm in Haskell and in Elixir. Knowledge I'm hoping to share: 
* a crash course or refresher in solving ODEs, 
* the practical applications of solving a differential equation numerically,
* why RK4 is really good at solving ODEs,
* how to use Haskell and Elixir to solve an ODE, 
* difference in performance using RK4 in both languages
----

Ok this is way too ambitious, maybe split this up into different topics
* ODEs/RK4 in Matlab
* Elixir Benchmarking
* Haskell and Functional Programming
