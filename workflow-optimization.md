# Workflow Optimizations
#### Christopher Stansbury
## Motivation
The purpose of these notes are to document my workflow optimizations, particularly as they relate to my day-to-day life and my job as a software engineer. 'Workflow optimizations' (by my personal definition) are any sort of "set it and forget it" task that saves time or decreases mental friction when making decisions. 

Here are some examples of workflow optimizations: 
- using a **day planner** to keep track of and plan important events
- using a **kitchen calendar** to plan out meals for the week
- learning and using **keyboard shorcuts**
- leveraging **reminder tools** to keep up with tasks
- using **calendar integration tools** to not have to mentally catalogue meetings
- using **Slack integration tools** to monitor uptime, track source code changes, notify of outages.

In the space below I will break each optimization down in detail and describe how it benefits me, along with any tools I use to implement the optimization.  

## Day Planner
 This one is simple. I purchased a 2022 Day Planner from Barnes and Noble. It has calendar pages for each month, with each day being large enough to fit 2-3 important events or bullet points. I check and update my day planner in the morning, when I sign off for work, and usually at night. Examples of things I write in my day planner:
 
 - Important or irregularly scheduled meetings or events (think important work meetings where I need to be fully locked in and probably need an hour or two beforehand to hype myself up, or events with friends that I need to dress up or prepare for in advance)
 - Holiday reminders (birthdays, 'Remember to buy abc for xyz')
 - Vacation days
 - Bill due dates

The only tool you need for this one is a day planner. I do also use a virtual calendar for most of my regular work meetings and Apple Reminders to ping myself if I have something going on at a certain time. But using the day planner helps me see a high-level overview of my day each morning, and gives me a satisfying box to check at the end of the day when I get to cross a line through the day on the calendar. I also find that using the day planner encourages me to set up meetings with people in advance and makes it less likely for potential meetups to not materialize once I've written it down.
