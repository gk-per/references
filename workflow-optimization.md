# Workflow Optimizations
### Christopher Stansbury
## Motivation
The purpose of these notes are to document my workflow optimizations, particularly as they relate to my day-to-day life and my job as a software engineer. 'Workflow optimizations' (by my personal definition) are any sort of "set it and forget it" task that saves time or decreases mental friction when making decisions. 

Here are some examples of workflow optimizations: 
- using a **day planner** to keep track of and plan important events
- using a **kitchen calendar** to plan out meals for the week
- learning and using **keyboard shorcuts**
- leveraging **reminder tools** to keep up with tasks
- using **calendar integration tools** to not have to mentally catalogue meetings
- using **Slack integration tools** to monitor uptime, track source code changes, notify of outages.

In the space below I will break each optimization down in detail and describe how it benefits me, along with any tools I use to implement the optimization.
